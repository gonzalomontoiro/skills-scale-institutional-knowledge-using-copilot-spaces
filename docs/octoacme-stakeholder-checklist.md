## Stakeholder Analysis Matrix

For each stakeholder or group, assess:

| Stakeholder | Power (H/M/L) | Interest (H/M/L) | Strategy | Primary Contact |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|----------|-----------------|
| [Example: Project Sponsor] | High | High | Manage Closely | PM |
| [Example: Customer Support] | Low | High | Keep Informed | Technical Writer |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Strategy Guide**:
- **High Power, High Interest**: Manage Closely (frequent updates, involve in decisions)
- **High Power, Low Interest**: Keep Satisfied (periodic updates, focus on outcomes)
- **Low Power, High Interest**: Keep Informed (regular updates, address concerns)
- **Low Power, Low Interest**: Monitor (minimal updates, inform of major changes)
