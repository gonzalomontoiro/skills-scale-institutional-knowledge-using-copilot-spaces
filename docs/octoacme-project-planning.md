# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives

- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
   - Include Scrum Master to align on ceremonies and team practices
   - Involve UX/UI Designer to clarify design requirements and research needs
   - Engage DevOps Engineer to identify infrastructure and deployment needs
   - Include Technical Writer to plan documentation deliverables
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
   - UX/UI Designer contributes design requirements and user stories
   - Technical Writer identifies documentation items
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - Facilitated by Scrum Master with development team
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
   - Include criteria for code review, testing, documentation, and deployment readiness
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
   - DevOps Engineer highlights infrastructure dependencies
   - Technical Writer notes documentation dependencies
6. Create release plan and milestone map
   - Coordinate with DevOps Engineer on deployment windows
